I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Ah, love was out to get me

That′s the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I′m in love
I'm a believer! I couldn't leave her if I tried

I thought love was more or less a given thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What′s the use in tryin′?
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain

Ah, then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I′m in love
I'm a believer! I couldn′t leave her if I tried, oh

Ah, Love was out to get me
Now, that's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Ah, then I saw her face, now I′m a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
Ah, I'm a believer! I couldn′t leave her if I tried

Yes, I saw her face, now I′m a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
Yeah, I'm a believer, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said, I′m a believer, yeah
I said, "I'm a believer, yeah"
