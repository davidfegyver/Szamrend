Creep on in
See, I′m ridin high
Kinda broke this evenin' y′all so all I got

Is five
I got five

Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm I'm the type that like to light another joint, like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it, but it ain′t enough on it
Go get the S.T.I.D.E.S.
Nevertheless I′m hella fresh rollin' joints like they′re cigarettes
So pass across the table like ping pong, I'm gone
Beating my chest like King Kong

It′s on, wrap my lips around a 40
When it comes they get another stogie
Fools all kick in like Shinobi
No, me ain't my homie to begin with
It′s too many heads to be
Proper to let my friend hit it

Unless you pull out the fat crispy
Five dollar bill on the real before it's history
'Cuz fools be havin′ a vacuum lungs
An′ if you let'em hit it for free you hella dumb, du-dumb dumb

I come to school with a taylor on my earlobe
Avoidin′ all the thick teasers, skeezers and weirdos
That be blowin' off the land like where the bomb at
Gimme two bucks, you take a puff and pass my bomb back
Suck up the dank like a slurpee
The serious bomb will make a niggie go delirious like Eddie Murphy
I got more growin′ pains than Maggie
'Cuz homies nag me
Ta take the dank out of the baggie

I got five on it, grab ya four, let′s get keyed
I got five on it, messin' wit' dat indo weed
I got five on it, it′s got me stuck and I′m toed back
I got five on it, partner, let's go half on a sack

I take sacks to the face whenever I can
Don′t need no crutch
I'm so keyed up
′Till the joint be burnin' my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa
Ta burn slow so the ashes won′t be burnin' in my hand, brah

Hoochies can hit, but they know they got ta pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension
′Cause I be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no, you better bring your own spliff, chief

Wassup, don′t babysit that
Better pass the joint, stop hittin' ′cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
'Cuz I know the weed in my sistem′s gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P-O
I know I failed ′cuz I done smoked major weed, bro
An' everytime we with Chris, that fool, rollin' up a fattie
But the Tanqueray straight had me

I got five on it, grab ya four, let′s get keyed
I got five on it, messin′ wit' dat indo weed
I got five on it, it′s got me stuck and I'm toed back
I got five on it, partner, let′s go half on a sack

Hey, make this right man, stop at the light, man
My yester-night thing got me hung off the night train
You fade, I face, so let's head to the east
Hit the stroll to 9-0 so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade to eight but I′m low budget
Still rollin' the two door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy indoor
I'm in the land gettin′ smoked with my kinfolk

I been smoked, yup I′ll spray an' lay′er down
I'm up in the O.A.K. the town, homies don′t play around
We down to blaze a pound
Then we ease up, speed up through the E.S.O.
Drink the V.S.O.P. pee up with the lemon squeeze up
An' everybody′s rolled up, I'm the roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch′a sticky dose′a
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do, kick in the feet
'Cuz where I be we need half like the foo-foo

I got five on it, grab ya four, let′s get keyed
I got five on it, messin' wit′ dat indo weed
I got five on it, it's got me stuck and I′m toed back
I got five on it, partner, let's go half on a sack
