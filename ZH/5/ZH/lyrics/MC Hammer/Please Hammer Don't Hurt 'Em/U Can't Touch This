You can′t touch this
You can't touch this
You can′t touch this

You can't touch this

My, my, my, my
(You can't touch this)
Music hits me so hard
Makes me say "Oh, my Lord
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet"

It feels good when you know you′re down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I′m known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

I told you, homeboy
You can′t touch this
Yeah, that's how we livin′, and ya know
You can't touch this

Look in my eyes, man
You can′t touch this
Yo, let me bust the funky Iyrics
You can't touch this

Fresh new kicks and pants
You got it like that
Now you know you wanna dance
So, move outta your seat
And get a fly girl
And catch this beat
While it's rolling

Hold on
Pump a little bit and let ′em know it′s going on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission, so fall on back
Let 'em know that you′re too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch

Yo, I told you
You can′t touch this
Why you standing there, man?
You can't touch this
Yo, sound the bell, school′s in, sucker
You can't touch this

Give me a song or rhythm
Making them sweat, that's what I′m giving them
Now, they know
You talk about the Hammer
When you′re talkin 'bout a show
That′s hyped and tight
Singers are sweatin'
So pass them a wipe or a tape
To learn
What it′s gonna take in the 90's to burn
The chart′s legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

That's word, because, you know
You can't touch this
You can′t touch this
Break it down!

Stop, Hammer time!

"Go with the flow", it is said
If you can′t groove to this, then you probably are dead
So, wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves
Run your fingers through your hair

This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Now move, slide your rump
Just for a minute, let′s all do the bump
(Bump, bump, bump)

Yeah
You can't touch this
Look, man
You can′t touch this

You'll probably get hyped, boy, ′cause you know you can't
You can't touch this
Ring the bell, school′s back in
Break it down!

Stop, Hammer time!

You can′t touch this
You can't touch this
You can′t touch this
Break it down!

Stop, Hammer time!

Every time you see me
That Hammer's just so hype
I′m dope on the floor
And I'm magic on the mic

Now, why would I ever
Stop doing this
With others making records
That just don′t hit?

I toured around the world
From London to The Bay
It's "Hammer! Go, Hammer! MC Hammer! Yo, Hammer!"
And the rest can go and play
"U Can't Touch This"

You can′t touch this
You can′t touch this
Yeah
You can't touch this

I told you
You can′t touch this
Too hype, you can't touch this
Yo, we′re outta here
You can't touch this
